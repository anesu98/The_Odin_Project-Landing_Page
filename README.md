# The_Odin_Project-Landing_Page

Hi there,

I don't know if you've been following my journey, but I am now making a landing page as my final CSS specific project [For the Odin Foundations. Woah there, I've still got too much to learn lol].

In this project, I am going to be recreating a landing page based on the images that will be in the folder titled 'reference'. The aim isn't to recreate the landing page pixel perfectly, but to demonstrate how far I have come in the task of learning CSS and HTML.

Again, I would like to thank the Odin Project for putting together such a wonderful guide and community in which learning to code has become so much easier. I would also like to thank other resources such as FreeCodeCamp as some of the explanations given in their courses and lessons have also helped progress me to this point.
